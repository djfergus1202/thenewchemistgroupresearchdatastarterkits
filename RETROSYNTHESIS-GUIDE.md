## Scoring System

### Pathway Score (0-100)

The overall pathway score is calculated based on:

1. **Synthetic Feasibility (40%)**
   - Reaction precedents
   - Known reaction mechanisms
   - Success rates from literature

2. **Commercial Availability (25%)**
   - Starting material accessibility
   - Cost of reagents
   - Supplier availability

3. **Step Efficiency (20%)**
   - Number of steps (fewer is better)
   - Average yields
   - Convergent vs linear

4. **Complexity (15%)**
   - Molecular complexity reduction per step
   - Functional group compatibility
   - Stereochemistry considerations

### SA (Synthetic Accessibility) Score

Range: 1-10 (lower is easier to synthesize)

Based on:
- Molecular size and complexity
- Number of chiral centers
- Ring complexity
- Functional group diversity
- Similarity to known molecules

Complex molecules: 20-50 pathways, max 6-8 steps
```

### 3. Model Selection
```
- NeuralSym: Best for drug-like molecules
- RetroStar: Best for exploring diverse pathways
- Seq2Seq: Fast, good for simple molecules
- Graph2Graph: Best for complex stereochemistry
```

### 4. Interpreting Results
```
Score > 90: Highly feasible, well-precedented
Score 80-90: Feasible, may require optimization
Score 70-80: Challenging, expert chemistry needed
Score < 70: Very difficult, consider alternatives
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No pathways found
**Solution**: 
- Check SMILES validity
- Increase max_steps parameter
- Change model selection
- Try "all" filter instead of "commercial"

### Issue: All pathways have low scores
**Solution**:
- Target may be too complex
- Consider different disconnection strategies
- Review starting material filters

### Issue: Expensive pathways
**Solution**:
- Enable cost optimization
- Filter by building blocks
- Increase pathway count to find alternatives
